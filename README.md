Optimization methods

Repository consists of two main modules:
1) **optimization_methods.py**- module with implementation of several classic optimization methods: 
     - gradient descent method (with different variations of this method);
     - newthon method;
     - gradient projection method (with implemented projection formulas);
     - conjucate gradients method.
2) **plot_methods.py** - module with implementation of plotting methods, provides possibility to plot:
     - functions of many variables in given intervals;
     - contour plots of functions;
     - contour plots of functions with the "stepping" of optimization method;
     - functions that are set implicitly;
